Question 2
The "git status command" is not mandatory to type in each time you run commonds
on git though it should be used frequently when in use to see which step was last saved.

The commands "ls", "git status", and "pwd" fail when typed after first typing node because
we have exited the main directory of our computer and have entered in javascript.
git.help or .help is the command used in search for a way to exit or other options.
